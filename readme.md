# rainbowconnection

RainbowConnection is built on Laravel and Ember.js (coming soon!) To run the app in your local environment, you'll need to run NGINX/Apache for the Laravel backend (Homestead recommended!) and use the Ember CLI (ember serve) to start the frontend application.

## Known Issues
* Still learning PHP/Laravel and Ember.js
* Creating more than 100 users in the local environment
